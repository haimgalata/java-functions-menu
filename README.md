# Arrays and Matrices Algorithms (Java)

This project contains several **Java exercises** focused on array and matrix manipulation, demonstrating algorithmic problem solving with loops, conditions, and functions.

## ðŸ“‹ Description
The project includes four main exercises:

### ðŸ”¸ Ex_1 â€“ Arrange Array
Rearranges integers in an array so that all negative numbers appear before positives.  
Zeros can appear in both sections.

### ðŸ”¸ Ex_2 â€“ Max Overlap
Finds the largest overlapping sequence between the end of one array and the beginning of another.

### ðŸ”¸ Ex_3 â€“ Similar Columns
Determines whether two matrix columns contain exactly the same set of unique values (order independent).  
Also checks whether **all columns** in the matrix are different.

### ðŸ”¸ Ex_4 â€“ Max Diagonal
Receives a square matrix and prints the diagonal (left or right) with the **maximum sum** of elements.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated
- Arrays (1D & 2D)
- Nested loops
- Functions and modular programming
- Conditional logic
- Input validation

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open this project in IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code.
2. Run each file `Ex_1.java` to `Ex_4.java` individually.
3. Follow the console instructions for input and output.
